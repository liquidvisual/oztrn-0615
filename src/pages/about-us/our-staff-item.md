Denise built this Adelaide based company following a career as a Chief Executive and Deputy Chief Executive of two large Victorian organisations. Denise works with management groups in many State Government, Local Government and private sector organisations both locally and internationally.

- Management development programs for a wide range of government and private sector organisations
- Facilitation of mergers
- Facilitating complex processes and workshops
- Executive coaching

Denise is also a keen mosaic artist and oil painter. She loves trying to capture something of the person in a portrait. Denise lives in the Clare Valley on weekends with her husband on their much loved property “Kennedya” where they garden to their hearts’ content. Denise cannot cook anything, so if she offers you food she has prepared, it is recommended that you refuse.
